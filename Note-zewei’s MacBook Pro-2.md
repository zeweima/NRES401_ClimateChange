# Signs of climate change

There are multiple signs suggest climate change is happening, two of types of them are: long-term change and extreme events.

## Temperature rise

By 2024, the global mean surface temperature has risen by 1.45°C compared with the pre-industrial level (1850-1900 average) [^WMO2024]. Recently, the warming rate accelerated.

## Ice melt

The climate change also causes the ice sheet melt. A community estimation of global glacier mass change (except for Greenland and Antarctic icesheets) from 2000 to 2023 reduces 5.4% of the total mass [^GlaMBIE2025].

The Arctic and Antarctic sea ice extent are two major ice sheets in the earth that are influenced by climate change. The monitoring data shows that both ice sheets are shrinking, and the ice extent reaches new low records in recent years.

### Some papers:

> Intro to **The GlaMBIE Team (2025)[^GlaMBIE2025]**: This paper presents a community estimate of global glacier mass changes from 2000 to 2023, revealing a significant reduction in glacier mass over this period. The study highlights the ongoing impact of climate change on glaciers worldwide. This paper also provides valuable data for understanding the contribution of glacier melt to sea-level rise.

## Sea level rise

Glacial and ice sheet melt directly leads to sea level rise. Since 1993, the global mean sea level has risen by ~10 cm, and the rate of rise has accelerated in 2024 (NASA, 2024).

The sea level rise threatens coastal cities. For instance, increased inundation risks, as shown in Ohenhen et al., (2024)[^Ohenhen2024].

## Extremes

Other aspects of climate change is the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme events, including drought, heatwaves, heavy precipitation/flooding, and wildfires. The direct causes of extreme are the changes of global and local temperature and precipitation patterns, which are influenced by climate change. Past studies has shown that the 1) annual hottest temperature. 2) annual coldest temperature, 3) annual maximum daily precipitation are increasing (IPCC WGI, 2021).

### Droughts

IPCC (fourth assessment report, I followed Trenberth et al., 2014's work) give a definitions: drought is defined as a 'prolonged absence or marked deficiency of precipitation', a 'deficiency of precipitation that results in water shortage for some activity or for some group' or a 'period of abnormally dry weather sufficiently prolonged for the lack of precipitation to cause a serious hydrological imbalance' [^Trenberth2014][^AghaKouchak2021]. From which, we could see that different groups/use cases may concerns different aspects of drought. Thus, the detection and identification of drought may depend on the definitions used. One widely used index is the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), in which both precipitation and temperature (potential evapotranspiration) are considered, and it also contains the time scale information. From a recent publication by Gebrechorkos et al., (2025)[^Gebrechorkos2025], we could see an increasing trend in droughts globally from 1981 to 2022, as shown in the figure below.

<details>

CRU-TS covers 1901–2022 and ERA5 spans 1950–2022. The time series are averaged over tropical and subtropical land areas (50° S to 50° N), excluding regions with average annual rainfall below 180 mm. For regions above 50° N, the spatial trend is based on the mean of MSWEP_hPET and MSWEP_GLEAM, as CHIRPS is available up to 50° N. The vertical lines indicate the period from 1950 to 1980, showing higher positive SPEI values based on ERA5 and CRU-TS compared with 1981–2022. (Gebrechorkos et al., 2025)</figcaption>
</figure>
</details>

Beyond that, recently studies pay special attention to "flash drought", characterized by rapid onset and intensification, often linked to extreme heat and low soil moisture [^Pendergrass2020][^Xing2023]. One example is the 2012 US flash drought in the Midwest region, which caused significant agricultural losses. Its mechanism and predictions remain an active research area.

#### Some papers

> Intro to **Van Loon et al., (2016)[^VanLoon2016]**: A perspective to call for combining nature aspects and human aspects in drought management.

> Intro to **Trenberth et al., (2014)[^Trenberth2014]**: A perspective paper discussed the possible reasons that leads to contradictory findings in drought research, highlighting the importance of recognizing definitions and data quality.

> Intro to **Gebrechorkos et al., (2025)[^Gebrechorkos2025]**: This paper investigates the global trends in droughts using SPET index from 1981-2022 with a specific focus on understanding the relative role of precipitation change and potential evapotranspiration to the trend. Overall, the authors find an increasing trend in droughts globally, and both P and PET (~58% to the change) matters.

> Intro to **Pendergrass et al., (2020)[^Pendergrass2020]**: This paper discusses the phenomenon and challenges of flash droughts. Firstly, flash drought presents as a worldwide challenge. It's formation include a combination of factors, such as climate driver and land-atmosphere interactions. These pose challenges for both monitoring and prediction, for instance, high frequency monitiring is needed, a comprehensive climate variables beyond precipitation is needed. Also the current models have limitions in predicting flash droughts, such as biased estimation for extreme events, the inacurate representation of land-atmosphere interactions, teleconnections etc. Along with the advocating for betterr monitoring and modeling, the authors highlightes using standardized approchches to identify to indentify flash drought, and suggested the neccesity of early warning systems for flash droughts management.

> Calculation of SPEI [^Beguería2014]:
> **Step 1**: Calculate the Climatic Water Balance ($D$)
>> $D_i = P_i - PET_i$ (P: water resources supply; PET: atmospheric water demand; *checking: sometimes, actual ET could replace P as a more direct measure of plant stress*)
>
>> **Step 2**: Aggregate the Water Balance ($D^k$) Here $k$ is the time scale of interest, as drought could happen in different time scales
>> $D_i^{k} = \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} D_{i-j}$
>
>> **Step 3**: Fit Distribution and Standardize. The idea is to compare current state with historical state.
>>>
>>> 1) Choose a Distribution: three-parameter log-Logistic distribution is generally used
>>> 2) Estimate the parameters of the distribution (e.g., using L-moments)
>>> 3) Calculate the cumulative probability ($F$) of $D_i^{k}$
>>> 4) Standardize $F$ to get SPEI value (using inverse standard normal distribution). 
>>> SPEI = $\Phi^{-1}(p)$
>>>>
>>>> - p=0.5 -> SPEI=0 (normal condition)
>>>> - p=0.1 -> SPEI$\approx$-1.28 (drier than 90% of historical conditions)
>>>> - p=0.9 -> SPEI$\approx$+1.28 (wetter than 90% of historical conditions)

### Wildfires

Wildfire is a natural process that shapes the earth system. Under climate change, the frequency and extent of wildfires are increasing in many regions. Some of those were beyond the "normal" conditions and causing significant ecological, economic, and social impacts [^Jones2022][^Jones2024]. For instance, the 2023 Canada wildfire and 2020 Australia wildfires.

Some observations for Figure [^Jones2024]:

- The extent and severity change of forest fire:
  - Figure E-G. Overall, there are more burn area (BA) in **Russia** (east and northeast Siberian taiga), **Europe** (e.g., Balkan mixed forests, Pindus and Dinaric mountains mixed forests), **western North America** (e.g., Sierra Nevada forests, North-Central Rockies forests, Muskwa-Slave lake forests, Fraser Plateau and Basin complex, and Northwest Territories taiga), **Chile** (Valdivian temperate forests), and **China** (Northeast China Plain deciduous forests and Hengduan Mountains conifer forests).

#### Some papers:

> Intro to **Jones et al., (2024)[^Jones2024]**: This paper analysis the correlation between different factor, both nature and human indicators, with forest burn area (BA) across the world. This paper reveals the complex causes of wildfire across different eco-regions. Climate change is an important influencer. For instance, decreased soil moisture increases the chance of wildfire and BA in most regions. The change in weather also increases BA. Beyond that, human activities also influence wildfire, in both positive and negative ways. For instance, in tropic forest in Amazon and Congo, the deforestation and increases the chance of wildfire, while in regions like southeast US and western US, fire management is helpful in reduce BA.

## IPCC report

### Scenarios in climate change research

The rationale of scenarios are:

1. Future is uncertain, especially for long-term prediction (e.g., 50 years or 100 years later). Scenarios provide a way to explore different possible futures based on varying assumptions about key driving forces.
2. Scenarios help in understanding the potential impacts of different policy choices and actions on climate change.
3. They facilitate communication and decision-making among policymakers, researchers, and the public by providing a common framework for discussing future climate change.

#### RCPs

RCPs is the abbreviation of Representative Concentration Pathways. They are greenhouse gas concentration (not emissions) trajectories adopted by the IPCC for its fifth Assessment Report (AR5) in 2014. There are four RCPs: RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6, and RCP8.5. The numbers refer to the possible range of radiative forcing values in the year 2100 relative to pre-industrial values (+2.6, +4.5, +6.0, and +8.5 W/m², respectively) [^Moss2010][^Vuuren2011].

- *Representative*: each of the RCPs represents a larger set of scenarios in the literature.  
- *Pathways*: are internally consistent sets of projections of the components of radiative forcing that are used in subsequent phases
- *Concentration*: emphasizes that concentrations are used as the primary product of the RCPs, designed as input to climate models

##### Definition of RCPs from IPCC:  

Scenarios that include time series of emissions and concentrations of the full suite of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols and chemically active gases, as well as land use/land cover (Moss et al. 2010). The word representative signifies that each RCP provides only one of many possible scenarios that would lead to the specific radiative forcing characteristics. The term pathway emphasises that not only the long-term concentration levels are of interest, but also the trajectory taken over time to reach that outcome (Moss et al. 2010). RCPs usually refer to the portion of the concentration pathway extending up to 2100, for which integrated assessment models produced corresponding emission scenarios. Extended concentration pathways describe extensions of the RCPs from 2100 to 2300 that were calculated using simple rules generated by stakeholder consultations, and do not represent fully consistent scenarios. Four RCPs produced from integrated assessment models were selected from the published literature and used in the Fifth IPCC Assessment, and are also used in this Assessment for comparison, spanning the range from approximately below 2°C warming to high (>4°C) warming best-estimates by the end of the 21st century: RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 and RCP8.5.

- RCP2.6: One pathway where radiative forcing peaks at approximately 3 W m–2 and then declines to be limited at 2.6 W m–2 in 2100 (the corresponding Extended Concentration Pathway, or ECP, has constant emissions after 2100).
- RCP4.5 and RCP6.0: Two intermediate stabilisation pathways in which radiative forcing is limited at approximately 4.5 W m–2 and 6.0 W m–2 in 2100 (the corresponding ECPs have constant concentrations after 2150).
- RCP8.5: One high pathway which leads to >8.5 W m–2 in 2100 (the corresponding ECP has constant emissions after 2100 until 2150 and constant concentrations after 2250).

**Usage of RCPs** [^Moss2008]:

1. Input to CMs
2. To facilitate pattern scaling of climate model outcomes. 
3. To explore the range of socioeconomic conditions consistent with a given concentration pathway. 
4. To explore the climate implications of spatial forcing patterns.
  
**Limitations of RCPs** [^Moss2008]:

1. They should not be considered forecasts or absolute bounds. 
2. They should not be considered policy-prescriptive.
3. The socioeconomic scenarios underlying each RCP should not be considered unique. 
4. The socioeconomic scenarios underlying the RCPs cannot be treated as a set with an overarching internal logic.
5. There are uncertainties in the translation of emissions profiles to concentrations and radiative forcing. 

#### Some cases:

> Intro to **Moss et al., (2010)[^Moss2010]**: This paper give a introduction to the new generation of scenarios, including the rationales, history and brieft description of generation process. It also discusses the integration of RCPs with socio-economic scenarios, which are later developed into SSPs.

> Intro to **Vuuren et al., (2011)[^Vuuren2011]**: This paper provides an detailed overview of the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), including their development, characteristics, and applications in climate change research. 

#### SSPs

The RCPs gives the possible trajectrories of forcing (greenhouse gas concentrations) to a certain level of radiative forcing in 2100. However, they do not provide information about the socio-economic conditions that lead to these trajectories. Therefore, Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) were developed to fill this gap. SSPs are scenarios that describe different pathways of socio-economic development, including factors such as population growth, economic development, technological progress, and environmental policies [^Moss2010][^Riahi2017]. The purpose of SSPs is to provide broad descriptions of future conditions that are relevant for both the analysis of emissions
drivers and mitigation strategies, and the analysis of societal vulnerability to climate change, climate impacts and potential adaptation measures [^ONeill2017]].

SSPs are the input for the integrated assessment models.

##### Definition of SSPs from IPCC
SSPs have been developed to complement the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). By design, the RCP emission and concentration pathways were stripped of their association with a certain socio-economic development. Different levels of emissions and climate change along the dimension of the RCPs can hence be explored against the backdrop of different socio-economic development pathways (SSPs) on the other dimension in a matrix. This integrative SSP-RCP framework is now widely used in the climate impact and policy analysis literature, where climate projections obtained under the RCP scenarios are analysed against the backdrop of various SSPs. As several emission updates were due, a new set of emission scenarios was developed in conjunction with the SSPs. Hence, the abbreviation SSP is now used for two things: On the one hand SSP1, SSP2, …, SSP5 are used to denote the five socio-economic scenario families. On the other hand, the abbreviations SSP1‑1.9, SSP1‑2.6, …, SSP5‑8.5 are used to denote the newly developed emission scenarios that are the result of an SSP implementation within an integrated assessment model. Those SSP scenarios are bare of climate policy assumption, but in combination with so-called shared policy assumptions (SPAs), various approximate radiative forcing levels of 1.9, 2.6, …, or 8.5 W m–2 are reached by the end of the century, respectively.

#### Some papers:

> Intro to **O'Neill et al., (2017)[^ONeill2017]**: This paper give an overview of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), including the rationales, intro to its development process, and high-level narratives for each SSP, the summary of the assumptions for 1) demographic and human development elements, 2) Economy & Lifestyle and Policies & Institutions elements, 3) Technology and Environment & Natural Resources elements.
> > **Example narrative for SSP3**: "A resurgent nationalism, concerns about competitiveness and security, and regional conflicts push countries to increasingly focus on domestic or, at most, regional issues. This trend is reinforced by the limited number of comparatively weak global institutions, with uneven coordination and cooperation for addressing environmental and other global concerns. Policies shift over time to become increasingly oriented toward national and regional security issues, including barriers to trade, particularly in the energy resource and agricultural markets. Countries focus on achieving energy and food security goals within their own regions at the expense of broader-based development, and in several regions move toward more authoritarian forms of government with highly regulated economies. Investments in education and technological development decline. Economic development is slow, consumption is material-intensive, and inequalities persist or worsen over time, especially in developing countries. There are pockets of extreme poverty alongside pockets of moderate wealth, with many countries struggling to maintain living standards and provide access to safe water, improved sanitation, and health care for disadvantaged populations. A low international priority for addressing environmental concerns leads to strong environmental degradation in some regions. The combination of impeded development and limited environmental concern results in poor progress toward sustainability. Population growth is low in industrialized and high in developing countries. Growing resource intensity and fossil fuel dependency along with difficulty in achieving international cooperation and slow technological change imply high challenges to mitigation. The limited progress on human development, slow income growth, and lack of effective institutions, especially those that can act across regions, implies high challenges to adaptation for many groups in all regions."
